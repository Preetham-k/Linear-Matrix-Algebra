Project Report on SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION (SVD) in Matrices.

Now a days Data generation is increasing day by day and is becoming a challenge for everyone. Storing such a huge amount of data and analyzing it afterwards is more complex problem in this digital decade. Not every data stored have necessary information or exact information but is a mixture of redundant data along with it. One such type of data storage is in the form of Images. Here in this paper we are trying to tackle the ways to reduce the image footprintâ€™s data by a process of data compression using Singular Value Decomposition. In order to demonstrate the image compression technique, an example image is used and singular value decomposition is applied to it. The simulation results have been attached to the report
